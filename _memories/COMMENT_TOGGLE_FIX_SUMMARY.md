# Comment Toggle Fix Summary

## Problem
The cmd-/ (comment toggle) keyboard shortcut wasn't working in Quarto-generated pages with Thebe integration, while it worked in the plain HTML version.

## Root Cause
The Thebe configuration was missing the `extraKeys` mapping for comment toggle shortcuts in the CodeMirror configuration.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Thebe Configuration (`src/includes/thebe.html`)
Added `extraKeys` to the `codeMirrorConfig`:
```javascript
"codeMirrorConfig": {
  "theme": "default",
  "lineNumbers": true,
  "autoCloseBrackets": true,
  "indentUnit": 4,
  "indentWithTabs": false,
  "smartIndent": true,
  "extraKeys": {
    "Cmd-/": "toggleComment",
    "Ctrl-/": "toggleComment"
  }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Comment Addon Loading (`src/assets/js/thebe-config.js`)
- Added verification that the comment addon is fully loaded before Thebe bootstrap
- Improved error handling in `configureCodeMirrorInstance()`
- Added verification that extraKeys were properly applied

### 3. Added Testing Capabilities
- Created `window.testCommentToggle()` function for programmatic testing
- Created `src/test-comment-toggle.js` comprehensive test script
- Created `src/test-comment-functionality.qmd` automated test page

## Files Modified
1. `src/includes/thebe.html` - Added extraKeys configuration
2. `src/assets/js/thebe-config.js` - Enhanced addon loading and error handling
3. `src/test-comment-toggle.js` - New test script (created)
4. `src/test-comment-functionality.qmd` - New test page (created)

## How It Works
1. When Thebe creates CodeMirror instances, it now includes the extraKeys configuration from the start
2. The comment addon is verified to be loaded before Thebe bootstraps
3. As a fallback, the mutation observer also configures any CodeMirror instances that might be created later

## Testing
To verify the fix is working:

### Browser Console Test
```javascript
// Quick test
window.quickCommentTest()

// Detailed test  
window.testCommentToggle()
```

### Manual Test
1. Open any .qmd page with code blocks (index.html, demo.html, etc.)
2. Click in a code editor
3. Press Cmd-/ (Mac) or Ctrl-/ (Windows/Linux)
4. The line should toggle between commented/uncommented

### Automated Test Page
Open `test-comment-functionality.html` in a browser - it will automatically run tests and display results.

## Affected Pages
All Quarto-generated pages that include Thebe via either:
- `include-in-header: includes/thebe.html` (most pages)
- `include-after-body: includes/thebe.html` (test pages)

This includes: index.qmd, demo.qmd, demo-eig.qmd, demo-mdp.qmd, demo-scalar-implicature.qmd, game23.qmd, rsa.qmd, and any future .qmd files that include Thebe.

## Best Practices Followed
1. **Thebe Configuration**: Used official codeMirrorConfig instead of post-initialization hacks
2. **CodeMirror**: Properly loaded comment addon and used standard extraKeys configuration
3. **Error Handling**: Added proper checks and error messages
4. **Testing**: Created comprehensive testing tools for verification
5. **Documentation**: Clear code comments and this summary document

## Future Maintenance
- The fix is centralized in `thebe.html` configuration
- Works with current Thebe 0.9.2 and CodeMirror 5.65.2
- Should continue working with future versions that support the same configuration format
