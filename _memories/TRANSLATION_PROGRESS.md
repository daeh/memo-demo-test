# CodeMirror Translation Progress

## Goal
Translate the working `test-codemirror-static-html.html` file step by step to match the qmd setup and understand why cmd-/ isn't working in qmd-generated pages.

## Step 1: Theme Change ✅

### What was changed:
1. Created `test-codemirror-static-html-translate.html` from the working HTML file
2. Changed CodeMirror theme from `'neo'` to `'default'` to match qmd files
3. Removed the neo theme CSS import

### Files:
- **Original**: http://localhost:4200/test-codemirror-static-html.html (theme: neo)
- **Translation**: http://localhost:4200/test-codemirror-static-html-translate.html (theme: default)
- **Verification**: http://localhost:4200/verify-translation.html

### Result:
✅ cmd-/ still works with the default theme

### Key Finding:
The theme change from 'neo' to 'default' does not affect cmd-/ functionality. This matches what the qmd files use.

## Next Steps:
- Step 2: Match the CodeMirror initialization method
- Step 3: Match the script loading order
- Step 4: Add Thebe wrapper
- Step 5: Convert to qmd format

## Current Status:
The translation file now uses the same theme as qmd files and cmd-/ continues to work correctly.
